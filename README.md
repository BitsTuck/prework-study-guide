# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is a foundational building tool for the coding bootcamp that I am starting on Monday. It was a good chance to review basic HTML and CSS concepts, and to learn new Javascript and Github techniques. It was built to demonstrate these old and new skills, and to get a feel for the types of skills we will be learning in bootcamp.

## Usage

The website is divided into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Notes for each of these skillsets can be kept and maintained in their respective sections, and used for future reference. In DevTools, we can see the Javascript at work, randomly generating which topic we should study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
